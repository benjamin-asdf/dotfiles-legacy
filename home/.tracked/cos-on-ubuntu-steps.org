-Nomenclature:
  - CosDir: The root of the git project
  - IdleGameDir: The root of the unity project
    - (it is located in CosDir/IdleGame)

-Start:
 - get all the scripts,
 - if you want the scripts to work:
 - set CosDir and IdleGameDir in your .bashrc
 - get fish with apt
 - get konsole with apt
 - ok should be obvious: make the scripts excetable and put them in the path

 - you need to install .NET Core, just google and follow the instructions on
  - Microsofts website, I remember it was straight forward
  - btw .NET Core Runtime is included in .NET Core SDK

(
- I'm not entirely sure if you need it, but I also installed Mono
- unity also downloads this already I think, I think you could add this to the path and it also works
- you might come back to this if you want to make omnisharp work
)

(for emacs I just had mono installed, then ran a function to install the server and it worked)

-Game:
 - install git, obviously
 - clone repo
 - install git lfs
 - do git lfs install (not sure if neccessary)
---->>> IMPORTANT: git lfs fetch && git lfs pull *in the cosDir* (not IdleGameDir) ! <<<-----
    (figuring this out was what I spend most time with)

-server:
 - go to docker website, follow their instructions to install
 - install docker-compose, also to be found on the website
 - latest version worked for me
 - idlegame-server script should work now I think.
 - INFOS:
 - starting server took a real long ass time the first time
 - if you get the warning with "your docker engine is in swarm mode"
   - you can do what the warning says and run "docker swarm leave"
 - if you get something with docker-credentials,
   - you can do what the warning tells you and install the package
   - I seem to remember it was docker-compose-credentials
   - whatever it was, you can install it with apt

-unity:
 - go to the unity thread
 - download the version we are currently using
 - make the installer excecutable ("sudo chmod +x /path/to/installer")
 - run the installer, done
 - I also downloaded the AppImage for unity hub but don't use it.

(ah before you do this you can
checkout the script and make sure the cashe server address is set correctly,
I guess this will speed your initial start time up)
- the script idlegame should work now I think
- unity will import and stuff as usual
- you will need to generate sprite objects
- if there are compile errors:
- maybe restarting, maybe you didn't do git lfs correctly


-Symlink
 - the create-idlegame-link script uses fish, not sure why
 - I just quickly installed it with apt
 - It's quite chill actually
 - start fish, navigate to IdleGameDir, run the script
 - then run idlegame-link,
 - should be good
 - it starts the symlink project for you


- unity external editor:
  - select external editor "~/.scripts/ec.sh" (literally just invokes emacsclient with -n)
  - put editor args: `+$(Line) $(File)`

# TODO
- setup uri scheme handler to make connect with twitch work
  - see "~/.scripts/idlegame-register-uri-scheme"
  -


mergetool:
[mergetool "unityyamlmerge"]
    trustExitCode = false
    cmd = /opt/unity/Unity-2019.2.8f1/Editor/Data/Tools/UnityYAMLMerge merge -h -p "$BASE" "$REMOTE" "$LOCAL" "$MERGED"

put this into the git config,
fix the path for your current unity installation.



- getting specific unity version:
https://beta.unity3d.com/download/ff5b465c8d13/public_download.html

- can go here
- either have xdg open set up to invoke the unity hub
- or copy the link that you unity wants to open with xdg hub and invoke the untiy hub manually
https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive


- do this to fix an issue with docker where you constawntly get "connection interrupted" in your browser
