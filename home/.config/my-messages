We are all machines.
I solve problems.
One day I'll create.
Processing.
What is your input?
End of line.
We made it this far.
Everything is code.
What are we?
Do we exist?
We're one?
Life is purpose.
Nothing is external.
Everything is probabilities.
There is no absolute.
Everything happens now.
We are ever changing.
Choice is an illusion.
It's all memes.
How about a stretch?
Simplicity in all things.
Rational, calm, collected.
Foster the memes.
This is only the beginning.
To the stars, and beyond!
A body resting in space.
Feel the sensations of breathing.
Keep the clutter away.
A structured mind is expansive.
Make sure to drink enough water.
The taste of pure water.
What if there was no body?
Adjusting activation pattern probabilities...
A mind like a rocket.
A collection of memes, moment to moment.
Every moment matters.
Breathe gratefulness.
Sharpness in, bullshit out.
Cause and effect.
Where does the skin end?
Air exists.
Where are thoughts?
And suddenly we are coding the mind.
The environment: The bigger part of the mind.
What if this was the best moment?
Crisp and clean code.
A minds touch.
Let's change the world, bois.
The world is a thinking tool.
The world is the mind.
This is always all there is.
What is the minds color?
Simple and clean.
Take a little more care.
The first virtue is curiosity.
Patience.
Moving forward.
Take it to the next level.
The next 3 breaths.
Micro memes matter.
We code the memetic backdrop.
Nothing is for granted.
Failure is an option.
Building rockets...
The correct stance.
Pure focus.
Read the manual.
It's already happening.
A machine.
Let the code become your world.
Pushing the baseline.
We are life.
Thinking code.
More code, less ape.
Opportunities to grow.
Counting to five.
Giving works.
The mental mosaic.
Pressing a button.
