We are all machines.
I solve problems.
One day I'll create.
Processing.
What is your input?
End of line.
We made it this far.
Everything is code.
What are we?
Do we exist?
We're one?
Life is purpose.
Nothing is external.
Everything is probabilities.
There is no absolute.
Everything happens now.
We are ever changing.
Choice is an illusion.
It's all memes.
How about a stretch?
Simplicity in all things.
Willpower is a muscle.
Rational, calm, collected.
Foster the memes.
This is only the beginning.
To the stars, and beyond!
Feel your body resting in space.
Feel the sensations of breathing.
Keep the clutter away.
A structured mind is expansive.
May you be free of suffering.
Make sure to drink enough water.
The taste of pure water.
What if you had no body?
Adjusting activation pattern probabilities...
A mind like a rocket.
Put a smile in your mind.
A collection of memes, moment to moment.
Every moment matters.
Breathe gratefulness.
Sharpness in, bullshit out.
Everything has a reason.
Where do your fingers end, and I begin?
Where does your skin end, and the air begin?
Where are thoughts?
Let consistency pervade everything.
Am I your tool, or are you, mine?
And suddenly you are coding your mind.
Knowledge is the most powerful thing in the world.
Remember to remember.
The bigger part of your mind is your environment.
What if this was the best moment?
Crisp and clean code.
A minds touch.
Let's change the world, bois.The world is a thinking tool
The world is the mind.
